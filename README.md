## Brief Project Description:
The SolarSTEM project is our collaborative initiative to integrate STEM/STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) concepts to address the challenges posed by extreme heat by proposing innovative solar energy-based solutions. Through this website, we provide comprehensive information about solar energy concepts, solar panel technology, energy storage, environmentally friendly engineering, and relevant mathematical and statistical aspects. A focus on visually appealing design aims to enhance user engagement, while educating and inspiring interest in STEM/STEAM.

## Problems Addressed:
With the increasing occurrence of extreme heat, this project aims to confront energy challenges by harnessing solar energy as an innovative solution. Our STEM/STEAM concept covers all relevant aspects to enhance understanding and awareness of solar energy and sustainability.

## Operation Principles of the Tool/Product (Website):
This website serves as a comprehensive information source, covering basic concepts, technology, engineering, art, mathematics, and statistics related to solar energy. Visually appealing design is created to enhance user engagement while providing informative educational resources.

Thank you for your interest and support in our SolarSTEM project!
